# TIMETABLE
Basically we are generating a timetable for 5 days in a week.
For this a hash map is created where we will set teacher name along with id..
After creating a hash map , two empty 1*4 arrays are created..
assignTeachers function is defined which firstly checks whether a slot is available in 1*4 array (includes).
if yes then finds first null slot and that index is found out and in that index slot[index], teacher id is filled...
